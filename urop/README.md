# Battery Data Analysis Project

Fall 2021

University of Michigan

Sponsors and Affiliates:
- Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP)
- Michigan Research and Discovery Scholars (MRADS)
- Research, Innovation, Service and Entrepreneurship (RISE) Program


## Goals

1. Contribute to the frontiers of battery research
2. Pick up practical analysis and programming skills
3. Learn how batteries work


### Research

- You pick what project you want to work on
- Theme: methods for battery lifetime modeling, estimation, and prediction
- Theme: data-driven analysis and modeling of battery behavior
- End goal: technical reports, presentations, and journal publications


### Programming

- Version control and project management in GitHub
- Python for data analysis and batery modeling (PyBAMM)
- Developing sound programming best practices to produce high-quality code


### Batteries

- Working principles of battery operation
- Basic materials science and electrochemistry of batteries
- How batteries are modeled from a systems perspective


## Format

- Weekly group check-ins
  - Report on work progress since last week
  - Discuss open questions, concerns, difficulties
  - Assign next steps for next week

- Work product
  - Share your work by creating Pull Requests in the repository

- Keep in touch via Slack

- How this semester will go:
  - For the first two weeks: get oriented with tools and project scope
  - Remaining time: commit to a specific project, goals, and finish it
  - Drop by Autolab 2032 during work hours if you want a dedicated space to focus
    - Doors are unlocked as long as at least one of us is there
  - I will host 'Office Hours' for 1 hour per week per student
