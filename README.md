# Fast Formation Project

Last Updated 10/4/2021.

Code and analysis results for the fast formation study.

Dataset consists of 40 pouch cells built, formed, and cycled at UM Battery Lab.

Data exported from [Voltaiq](https://voltaiq.co).


## Getting Started

First, set up a virtual environment (e.g. using `pyenv`) for this project.

The code runs on Python 3.8.8.

Inside your virtual environment, install the necessary packages using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Download the raw data files

The raw battery data is not stored in this repo. Download a copy of the data [here](https://doi.org/10.7302/pa3f-4w30).


#### Set up input/output folders

Modify `paths.yaml` to point to your local paths. For example:

```

 data: '/Users/aweng/code/fast-formation/data/'
 outputs: '/Users/aweng/code/fast-formation/output/'
 documents: '/Users/aweng/code/fast-formation/documents/'

```

#### Python: Test your environment

Start in the root directory of the repository.

Run `pytest` to make sure that tests are passing.

```
python -m pytest
```

This will make sure that your paths and environment are set up correctly.

## Getting Started: Correlations Matrix

![Example correlations matrix](../main/assets/example_correlation_matrix.png)

The data beghind the correlation matrix can be generated by running the following commands:

```
python

>>> from src.utils import build_correlation_table
>>> build_correlation_table()
```

`build_correlation_table()` will take in a `summary_esoh_table.csv` and return an augmented table containing the complete feature-set.

The output file will be dumped in the specified output directory, e.g
`output/correlations.csv`.

A cached copy of the output file is available as part of the [dataset](https://doi.org/10.7302/pa3f-4w30), e.g. `output/correlations.csv`.


## Getting Started: Voltage Fitting Analysis

![Example correlations matrix](../main/assets/example_dvdq.png)

To get started with the voltage fitting analysis, start with `matlab/process_voltage_curves.m`, which will return a `.csv` file containing electrode-specific state of health (eSOH) metrics, e.g. (`summary_esoh_table.csv`)


## Running notebooks

Start a Jupyter Lab session using:

```
jupyter lab
```

## MATLAB

MATLAB R2020a was used to run the electrode-specific state of health (eSOH)
algorithm used to generate outputs for the electrode stoichiometry model. The
source code is available under the `/matlab/` directory.

The main function to run is `process_voltage_curves.m`. This function will read
in the relevant input files from the formation tests and return diagnostic
signals.

The paths for the MATLAB executables assume the current folder is the base
directory of the repository and that the `data` and `output` folders are one level
above this directory. Before running the code, add the `/matlab/` directory
into the path using `addpath matlab`. Do not run the code from the `/matlab/` folder.

## RStudio

RStudio is used to run the test for the differences in the coefficients of
variation.
